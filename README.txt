This is a basic mario game I created to get an understanding of graphics in Java. You can go into edit mode by pressing 'e' or 'E'
which enables you to draw bricks onto the screen with your mouse. You can save these changes by pressing 's' or 'S' which will load
the same map the next time you run the game. You can also load a map by pressing 'l' or 'L' but this functionality doesn't work as well
since we load the map when the program is ran rather than manually doing it. This program features working collision detection and jumping physics.
